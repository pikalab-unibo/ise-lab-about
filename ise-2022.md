## About the Lab

### Workflow 

We address the engineering of intelligent systems (IS)
* here intended as  
    > systems composed by one or more _autonomous_ and _intelligent_ **agents**, situated into some **environment**, pursusng either individual or collective goals

``Divide et impera'' approach:
1. let's elicit most fundametal mechanisms of IS
2. let's analyse each aspect individually, discussing 
    - the most adequate software _abstractions_ supporting them
    - their engineering w.r.t. software _technologies_
    - their reification as code 
3. let's compose them together, to enable (more) complex behaviours
4. let's discuss what we get, and what is missing
5. let's discuss about project / theses concering
    - topics not fully explored in the course
    - open problems from the AI literature
    - lacking technologies from the current state of the art

### Vision

Some notions should already be clear ATM, others will be clarified in future lectures by prof. Omicini.

Here we just provide insights and spoilers.

#### Agent

Any entity capable of _acting_
- situated into some **environment**
    * which can be _perceived_ and _affected_
- possibly, along with other agents
    * with which _interaction_ is possible
- "acting" here means "affecting the environment, and possibly the agents therein contained to pursue a given **goal**"

Examples of agents:
- human beings
- OS processes
- OS threads
- logic solvers
- BDI agents
- ...

##### Goal

A (possibly partial) description of the state of the world (i.e., the environment + other agents) to be reached

Examples of goals:
- vacuum robot: "the floor should be clean"
- autonomous car: "reach destination X"
- virtual personal assistant: "reminder of meeting, 15 minutes before its start"

##### Autonomous agents

Agents are **autonomous** when they encapsulate (i.e. control) the criterion <!--  by which they act -->
<!-- - many possible declinations of autonomy are possible (cf. Prof. Omicini's slides) -->
- by which they select which goals to pursue (motivational autonomy)
- and/or by which they choose which action to do to while pursuing a goal (executive autonomy)

Examples:
- human agents are autonomous
- software agents may be more or less autonomous depending on how they have been programmed

##### Intelligent agents

Agents are **intelligent** when they are capable of cognitive behaviours, and they know how to use them to pursue their goal(s)
- perceiving stimuli and recognise abstractions on top of them
- representing knowledge (e.g. perceptions, abstractions, goals, actions, etc) and memorise it for later re-use
- learning from the experience (i.e. generalise the gathered knowledge)
- planning courses of action to pursue goals
- reasoning about knowledge (to deduce implicit knowledge, to induce new knowledge, to abduce hypothes)
- interact with other agents to exchange information (goals, knowledge, plans)
- etc.

Examples:
- human agents behave intelligently (most of the times)
- software agents require cognitive capabilities to behave intelligently
    + plus some criterion to decide when and how to use them

> Behaviours may or may not be considered as intelligent depending on the context it is applied into

Examples:
- agent stepping through the window at ground floor
- agent stepping through the window at Nth floor

#### Environment

Where agents live and (inter)act. A.k.a. What is external w.r.t. agents.
- enables and constraints agents interaction, perception, and actuation

Examples:
- human beings -> phisical world / social media / ...
- roomba -> a house and its floor
- chat bot -> chat groups
- autonomous car -> the road
- OS process/thread -> file system + network + environment variables + I/O
- ...

##### Perception

The operation by which agents gather information about the environment
+ agents may represent, memorise, and manipulate perceived information

Examples: 
- human beings: 5 senses + introspections
- robots: input sensors providing raw measurements (cameras, lisars, etc.)
- software agents: stdin + other input files, environment variables, system clock, network channels, serial ports, etc.

##### Actuation

The operation by which agents affect the environment
+ agents may be provided with number of elementary actions
+ to be combined in infinitely many ways

Examples: 
- human beings: hands, feets, virtually any limb of our bodies, speech
- robots: actuators (wheels, arms, leds, etc.) 
- software agents: stdout + other output files, environment variables, network channels, serial ports, etc.

##### Interaction

Where agents affect (and are affected by) each others
+ agents may represent, store, and manipulate perceived information

Examples: 
- human beings: 5 senses + introspections
- robots: input sensors providing raw measurements (cameras, lisars, etc.)
- software agents: stdin + other input files, environment variables, system clock, network channels, serial ports, etc.

### About the lab

#### Fundametal mechanisms of IS

1. Knowledge representation
    + How is information represented to favour memorisation and manipulation

2. Inference
    + How novel/explicit knowledge is attained from prior/implicit knowledge

3. Perception/actuation
    + How information exchange with the environment occurs

4. Planning
    + How courses of actions (directed towards some goal) are computed

5. Learning
    + How experience is transformed into knowledge

6. BDI agents
    + Where all such aspects are tied together

7. Environment and artefacts
    + Where interactions are coordinated

##### Special Guests

- eXplanable AI (XAI): post-hoc vs. by-construction
    + Extract symbolic knowledge out of sub-symbolic predictors (e.g. NN)
    + Inject symbolic knowledge into sub-symbolic predictors (e.g. NN)

- Argumentation
    + letting agents reach shared agreements by arguing

#### Orthogonal topics 

Topics necessary to understand two or more mechanisms

- Computational logics
    + Computational logic is the use of logic to perform or reason about computation
    + Necessary or useful for: knowledge representation, reasoning, planning, learning, and perception

- Data science (a.k.a. machine learning, a.k.a. data mining)
    + we assume some background on this topic!
    + Necessary or useful for: perception, learning, inference, knowledge representation

#### Necessary technologies

- JVM -> Java/Kotlin + Gradle

- Prolog -> 2P-Kt | SWI-Prolog 

- Python -> Pip + Virtualenv | Pyenv 
    * SciKit-Learn
    * 2ppy
    * Psyke
